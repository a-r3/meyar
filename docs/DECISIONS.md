# MEYAR — Decisions

Append-only log of concise architectural/product decisions. Format: id, date,
decision, why, reversibility.

## D-006 — Prohibited-criteria check is a regex denylist, not NLP

**Date:** 2026-08-18
**Decision:** Backend rejection of sensitive/irrelevant job criteria
(gender, age, ethnicity, religion, marital status, health, etc. —
MASTER_SPEC.md §4) is implemented as a case-insensitive regex-pattern
denylist over each criterion's `label`/`value` text
(`meyar.schemas.criteria`), not a classifier or NLP model.
**Why:** Deterministic, dependency-free, fast, and testable — matches the
project's "no LLM in the trust-sensitive validation path" and "no
overengineering for MVP" policies. Known limitation: heuristic word-boundary
matching can false-positive on legitimate terms that contain a denylisted
word as a substring-with-punctuation (e.g. "Single Sign-On" contains
"single"); it can also miss creatively-obfuscated attempts. Acceptable for
MVP since criteria are entered by the tenant's own hiring staff via the
API, not adversarial candidate input — the higher-stakes prompt-injection
boundary is CV content (see SECURITY_PRIVACY.md), which is unaffected by
this list.
**Reversibility:** Fully reversible/tunable — the pattern list is a single
module-level constant; false positives can be fixed by narrowing a pattern
without any schema or migration change.

## D-001 — Dev/test machine is not Apple Silicon; use small model for dev

**Date:** 2026-08-18
**Decision:** Preflight found the actual working machine is a Linux laptop
(Intel i7-1165G7, 8 threads, 7.5GB RAM, no discrete GPU), not the Apple
Silicon Mac the spec assumes. Use `qwen2.5-coder:3b` (already pulled, 1.9GB)
behind `LLMProvider` for all development/testing on this machine. Final
production model selection (Qwen3.5-9B, fallback 4B, or Ministral 3) is
deferred until real Mac hardware is available to benchmark, per spec §2.
**Why:** Spec explicitly forbids finalizing the model before inspecting real
hardware; running a 9B/4B model on 7.5GB total RAM (often <1GB free) is not
reliable.
**Reversibility:** Fully reversible — swapping `OLLAMA_MODEL` env var and
pulling a new model is a config change, no code change, due to the
`LLMProvider` abstraction.

## D-002 — Queue: Postgres-backed table + in-process asyncio worker

**Date:** 2026-08-18
**Decision:** MVP async evaluation queue is a Postgres table (`evaluation`
row with status) polled by an in-process asyncio worker loop inside the same
app process, behind a `JobQueue` interface.
**Why:** Spec forbids Kafka/microservices for MVP and asks for "the simplest
reliable background-job mechanism that fits." Avoids a second infra
dependency (Redis/broker) while remaining swappable later.
**Reversibility:** Reversible — `JobQueue` interface can be re-implemented
against a real broker without changing callers.

## D-003 — No self-service API key issuance endpoint in MVP

**Date:** 2026-08-18
**Decision:** Tenants and their first API key are minted via an internal
CLI (`meyar create-tenant`), not a public endpoint.
**Why:** No admin UI/auth model for "who is allowed to create a tenant" yet;
building that is out of MVP scope. Customers still authenticate with real
issued keys against the real API.
**Reversibility:** Reversible — an admin API can be added later without
changing the key format or verification path.

## D-005 — Postgres dev container uses host networking on port 55719

**Date:** 2026-08-18
**Decision:** `docker-compose.yml`'s `postgres` service uses `network_mode:
host` and listens on `127.0.0.1:55719`, instead of the usual bridge network
+ published port.
**Why:** On this shared dev machine, bridge-network port publishing (via
`docker-proxy`) was observed to stall *new* connections for 30-60s+ (up to
full asyncpg 60s connect timeouts) under memory pressure, causing the test
suite to fail with `TimeoutError`. Host networking removes the
`docker-proxy` hop and connections became consistently sub-100ms. Ports
5432/55432/55433 were already occupied by other unrelated projects on this
machine; 55719 was confirmed free.
**Reversibility:** Fully reversible — revert to bridge networking + a
published port if this machine's networking stabilizes or in a
non-shared/production environment; no application code depends on the
networking mode.

## D-004 — Retention periods left as configurable policy

**Date:** 2026-08-18
**Decision:** No hardcoded legal retention period. Retention is a config
value (default: keep until explicit deletion), deletion cascades are
implemented and tested, exact numbers are an open owner decision.
**Why:** Spec explicitly forbids inventing final legal retention periods.
**Reversibility:** Reversible — config value.
